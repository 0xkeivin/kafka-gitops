1. Discuss your proposed change in a GitHub issue first before spending time and implementing a feature or fix.

2. Ensure all changes are relevant to the pull request. Keep pull requests as small and to-the-point as possible.

3. Add & modify tests as necessary. Also, ensure the code matches the existing style.

4. Once changes are completed, open a pull request for review against the master branch.
